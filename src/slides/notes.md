Prospective, Multi-Center Evaluation of the Clinical Utility (PRECIsE) 
a post-market, multi-center clinical trial of its Ion endoluminal system.

Initial abstract published Sensitivity for cancer was 33/38 (87%) for nodules ≤2cm and for nodules >2cm was 12/13 (92%); p=1.0. 
 Sensitivity for cancer was 43/51 (84%, 95% CI: 71.4–93.0) considering definitive malignancies
 Diagnostic yield was 57/69 (83%, 95% CI: 71.6–90.7). Yield for nodules ≤2cm was 40/49 (82%) and for nodules >2cm was 17/20 (85%); p=1.0. No serious adverse events were reported. One (1.4%) asymptomatic pneumothorax was reported: no chest tube was placed.

Methods
- Using ion 
- 66 patients enrolled
- single center study  Mountain View, California Interventional Pulmonology (IP) clinic of the Palo Alto Medical Foundation (PAMF)
- September 2019 to June 2020 


Procedure Methods
- getA 
- using PEEP 10, TV 8, neuromuscular blockade 
- robotic navigation to target lesions
- remove vision probe and replace with biopsy needle
- CBCT for confirmation of location, second need, then final spin for pneumothorax
- rapid onset cytology guide the need for additional biopsies


# Strengths

# Weaknessess
- single center study 
 Mountain View, California Interventional Pulmonology (IP) clinic of the Palo Alto Medical Foundation (PAMF)
- we don't use CBCT
- is higher yield with robotic or just with CBCT
